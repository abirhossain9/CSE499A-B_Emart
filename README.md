The E-Mart System Website will allow a user to set up any kind of small to medium sized business. A user can easily sign up as vendor and set up their business without any cost. We will also focus on Farmers on rural areas. We know our framers do not get proper value for their hard work cultivating crops. They need to go to another person to sell at a cheap price and that person sell the goods to a market with a good interest and then the customers buy the goods. basically a Farmer need to find a middle man to sell his cultivated good. But with our project we will be able to cut out that middle man and then the farmers will be able to sell to market and get a better value than what he will get. We will add Bangla Language to make the process easier for rural peoples. We will also be adding Delivery Services for customers. it will comes with extra charges and sometimes depends on weight.
